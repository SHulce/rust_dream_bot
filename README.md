Rust Dream Bot
----------------------------------

The Rust Dream Bot is a simple project building a Discord chatbot in the Rust programming language. I am utilizing the Serenity framework and Serde JSON crates.

I am currently extending the project to perform chat based queries of the D&D 5e SRD public information. I am utilizing the JSON formatted data provided by BTMorton so full credit to them for the JSON data. The original repo for that data may be found [here](https://github.com/BTMorton/dnd-5e-srd)

I will flesh out this README over time as the project evolves and provide information on how to run your own version of the Rust Dream Bot for your own server in the coming weeks.
